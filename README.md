# Multiplanar Reconstruction

A simple MPR (multiplanar reconstruction) in python

## Getting Started

The objective of this project is to slice successfullya set of images to show its anatomical planes (axial, sagittal and coronal planes)

### Prerequisites

To run this project you'll need [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

```bash
pip install numpy
```
## Running the test

The [main.py](/src/main.py) of this project shows how you can slice te set of images to get the anatomical planes. Here we get the images from a directory, choose what slide will be shown and then plot it in the screen.
